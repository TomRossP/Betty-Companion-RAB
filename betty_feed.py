"""
Betty Local Racecard Feed Reader
================================
Betty receives its race cards from SIS / TRP / Tote into C:\\Events as binary `.dat` files,
rewritten throughout the day. This module decodes them into the runner list pre-flight uses,
so selections are checked against exactly the card Betty itself shows (no internet needed).

File name: <day><month><year><FEED>.dat
  day   1-9 then a=10 ... v=31      month 1-9 then a=Oct, b=Nov, c=Dec      year v=2023, w=2024 ...
  e.g. kayHGB00.dat = 20 Oct 2026 SIS horse racing. Past days are kept in C:\\Events\\ARCHIVE.

.dat layout (little-endian, fixed-size blocks):
  header        145 bytes; uint16 meeting count at 111
  meeting       21976 bytes each: name @+11, midnight timestamp @+37, uint16 race count @+42,
                2-char country @+48 (UK/IE/FR/US..., VR = virtual)
  race          730 bytes each from meeting+88: timestamp @+46 (off time = ts - midnight), uint32 event id @+62,
                int32 runner indexes @+80 until -1, listed in saddle-cloth order
  runner table  97-byte records after the last meeting block; name @+12

When a race goes off Betty writes an off slip ("Clifton Park1 19:36 sent off automatically at ...", a View Wagers
number of its own) to C:\\DBF\\transact.DBF: TRANS_TYPE 87, DEALER_2 = the event id, DATE / TIME = when Betty marked
it off, normally seconds after the off. BettyOffTimes reads them.
