"""
Betty Companion: the control window. Staff use it instead of bettycomplaunch.bat.

    BettyCompanion.exe              this window
    BettyCompanion.exe --backend    the program itself (betty_companion.main), started and stopped by this window
    python launcher.py              the same, from the source folder

The window runs the program as a second process and talks to it through pipes: commands one per line on its stdin
(start, pause, test, live, status, quit), status events as JSON lines on its stdout (betty_companion section 7).
When the window closes, its end of the pipe closes and the program shuts down, so it never runs unwatched.

Tabs: Controls (Start / Pause / Stop, the live / test switch), System (this run's and the previous run's log, the
errors explained, what staff had to do, and Settings: pairing with the relay), Data (today's racecard files and
meetings), Runners (every UK & Irish horse runner today), Help (how to run it). The bar at the bottom always shows whether it's ready to
automate (hover for why not) and whether Gemini is online.
